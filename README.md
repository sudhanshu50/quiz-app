Develop a Quiz App using React and Redux that includes a minimum of 30 questions per language. The app should support quizzes in at least seven different languages.

Ensure that, upon completion of the quiz, the user is presented with their result, which includes their name.

Create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface for the Quiz app. Focus on presenting questions and answer choices clearly and effectively.

Enhance the user experience by incorporating interactive elements. Include progress indicators to track the user's progress. Provide immediate feedback for both correct and incorrect answers. Use visually distinct buttons for navigation and submission.

Optional:

Implement a review feature that allows users to revisit their answered questions. They should be able to view the correct answers and access explanations or additional information for each question.
